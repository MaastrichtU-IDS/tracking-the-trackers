VPN related introduction

A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across the VPN may, therefore, benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.

Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.

VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.

Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.",General scam & Pishing,Scam (Online Fraud),Crawler search,Google play,Software registry,YES

of them is an important cyber defense task. The main defense paradigm in this
regard is that the defender uses some kind of machine learning algorithms to
train a detection model, which is then used to classify websites in question.
Unlike other settings, the following issue is inherent to the problem of
malicious websites detection: the attacker essentially has access to the same
data that the defender uses to train its detection models. This 'symmetry' can
be exploited by the attacker, at least in principle, to evade the defender's
detection models. In this paper, we present a framework for characterizing the
evasion and counter-evasion interactions between the attacker and the defender,
where the attacker attempts to evade the defender's detection models by taking
advantage of this symmetry. Within this framework, we show that an adaptive
attacker can make malicious websites evade powerful detection models, but
proactive training can be an effective counter-evasion defense mechanism. The
framework is geared toward the popular detection model of decision tree, but

Bluetooth Low Energy beacons are starting to appear everywhere: shops, cafeterias, malls, stadiums, museums, and many other venues. This app gives you a glimpse of what is actually immediately close to you. Unlike other similar apps, you have all the details that you'll ever need about any type of beacon that is around you, or was recently.

Quickly detect and see details about any beacon around you, using the best beacon Android scanner around. No matter what iBeacon or Eddystone beacon is around you (Estimote, Kontakt, RECO, OnyxBeacon, or any other kind of model), this app will find it instantly.

Easily view all the details that you need about each detected beacon, including:
- for Physical Web (Eddystone) beacons: view the broadcasted URL or UID, and tap to open it in your browser
- for iBeacon-compatible devices: major ID, minor ID, and Proximity UUID
- device name and beacon proximity, updated in real-time
- average signal strength (RSSI) during the last few seconds
- Measured Power level; MAC address
- number of RSSI samples received from the beacon over the last few seconds
- when the beacon was last seen by your device

Special features: notification alert when a new beacon is found; all beacons are sorted automatically by distance; the beacon scanning is running automatically as long as the app is not manually shutdown from the running apps list.

What's a beacon?
A beacon is a tiny Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy device that can be detected by a compatible smartphone device from up to 50 meters away, without any need to pair or connect to it. Detecting beacons is very battery-friendly, unlike GPS. This allows proximity-aware applications to react differently for each beacon it finds, depending on the beacon and the application.

This application uses our custom Android beacon detection library, which we are working on since 2014. 
Beacon Monitor uses OneBeacon - http://onebeacon.io , our universal beacon platform that can make your app quickly interact with any type of Bluetooth Low Energy beacon.

community concern about the risks they pose to critical infrastructure,
corporations, and citizens. In order to reduce this risk, the IETF is pushing
IoT vendors to develop formal specifications of the intended purpose of their
IoT devices, in the form of a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD), so that
their network behavior in any operating environment can be locked down and
verified rigorously. This paper aims to assist IoT manufacturers in developing
and verifying MUD profiles, while also helping adopters of these devices to
ensure they are compatible with their organizational policies and track devices
network behavior based on their MUD profile. Our first contribution is to
develop a tool that takes the traffic trace of an arbitrary IoT device as input
and automatically generates the MUD profile for it. We contribute our tool as
open source, apply it to 28 consumer IoT devices, and highlight insights and
challenges encountered in the process. Our second contribution is to apply a
formal semantic framework that not only validates a given MUD profile for
consistency, but also checks its compatibility with a given organizational
policy. We apply our framework to representative organizations and selected
devices, to demonstrate how MUD can reduce the effort needed for IoT acceptance
testing. Finally, we show how operators can dynamically identify IoT devices
using known MUD profiles and monitor their behavioral changes on their network.",Behavioural tracking,Advertising,Crawler search,Arxiv,Research,YES

posted in order to boost or diminish the ratings of listed products and

detect elite Sybil attacks. We show that contemporary elite Sybil attacks have
a hybrid architecture, with the first tier recruiting elite Sybil workers and
distributing tasks by Sybil organizers, and with the second tier posting fake

then identifies the campaign windows, and finally identifies elite Sybil users

so-called relying parties (RPs), to delegate user authentication to identity
providers (IdPs), such as Facebook or Google. These systems are very popular,
as they provide a convenient means for users to log in at RPs and move much of
the burden of user authentication from RPs to IdPs.
  There is, however, a downside to current systems, as they do not respect
users' privacy: IdPs learn at which RP a user logs in. With one exception,
namely Mozilla's BrowserID system (a.k.a. Mozilla Persona), current SSO systems
were not even designed with user privacy in mind. Unfortunately, recently
discovered attacks, which exploit design flaws of BrowserID, show that
BrowserID does not provide user privacy either.
  In this paper, we therefore propose the first privacy-respecting SSO system
for the web, called SPRESSO (for Secure Privacy-REspecting Single Sign-On). The
system is easy to use, decentralized, and platform independent. It is based
solely on standard HTML5 and web features and uses no browser extensions,
plug-ins, or other executables.
  Existing SSO systems and the numerous attacks on such systems illustrate that
the design of secure SSO systems is highly non-trivial. We therefore also carry
out a formal analysis of SPRESSO based on an expressive model of the web in
order to formally prove that SPRESSO enjoys strong authentication and privacy
properties.",VPN,Geoblocking,Crawler search,Arxiv,Research,YES

protocol, one can estimate the monetary worth of different users for the
programmatic advertising ecosystem, even when the so-called winning bids are
encrypted. In this paper we describe how to implement the above techniques in a
practical and privacy preserving manner. Specifically, we study the privacy
consequences of reporting back to a centralized server, features that are
necessary for estimating the value of encrypted winning bids. We show that by
appropriately modulating the granularity of the necessary information and by
scrambling the communication channel to the server, one can increase the
privacy performance of the system in terms of K-anonymity. We've implemented
the above ideas on a browser extension and disseminated it to some 200 users.
Analyzing the results from 6 months of deployment, we show that the average
value of users for the programmatic advertising ecosystem has grown more than

undergraduates over a span of two months. Preserving user identity in the data
set allows us to discover novel properties of Web traffic that directly affect
models of hypertext navigation. We find that the popularity of Web sites -- the
number of users who contribute to their traffic -- lacks any intrinsic mean and
may be unbounded. Further, many aspects of the browsing behavior of individual
users can be approximated by log-normal distributions even though their
aggregate behavior is scale-free. Finally, we show that users' click streams
cannot be cleanly segmented into sessions using timeouts, affecting any attempt
to model hypertext navigation using statistics of individual sessions. We
propose a strictly logical definition of sessions based on browsing activity as
revealed by referrer URLs; a user may have several active sessions in their
click stream at any one time. We demonstrate that applying a timeout to these
logical sessions affects their statistics to a lesser extent than a purely
timeout-based mechanism.",Web beacon tracker,Advertising,Crawler search,Arxiv,Research,YES
