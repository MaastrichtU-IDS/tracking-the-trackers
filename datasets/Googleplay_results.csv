Who is Joe the Web Guy?

Joe Levi, known to his friends as Joe the Web Guy, is a web geek and CSS guru with 17 years' experience in web development; HTML markup; styling with CSS; and enhancing user experiences with javascript, jquery, HTML5, CSS3, and more!

He was hired by his current employer to fill the position of Web Application Developer left vacant by their previous Web Developer. Previously Joe worked for an advertising agency as their interactive Technology Director, and developed projects for clients such as 3M HIS, Novell, 3COM, and Sundance Resort. He performed contract work for a local dot com, building their first B2C e-commerce shopping cart solution. He even worked for a local pseudo-celebrity (Dell ""SUPERDELL"" Schanze) where he wore many hats (including Sharepoint Developer and various technical and management positions).

Joe was a Web of Trust Notary, endorsed by Thawte (a Verisign company), and experienced with x.590 Digital Signature Certificates. Joe believes in the widespread use of PKI Encryption technologies and methodologies as potentially being the ""magic bullet"" in eliminating online fraud, identity theft, and even casual snooping.

Give Joe a pair of headphones and a can of anything ""cold and caffeinated"" and he can code for hours on end. He can work efficiently as a solo developer and is also at-home when working as part of a development team.

When asked, Joe tells people that it's not really that he knows all that much, rather that he's just really good at figuring things out.

In the years since Joe began his employment with his current employer, he has been instrumental in realizing several projects and keeps existing sites and solutions up-to-date and running smoothly.

Although Joe can work inside the constraints and scope of a project, he has a hard time ""thinking inside the box"" and can often see the larger picture and offer ideas, thoughts, or ""what-if"" scenarios that can help ""future-proof"" a given project to extend the value and business-returns.",online shopping fraud

VPN related introduction

A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.

Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.

VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.

Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.",online law enforcement

What is a VPN?


A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.

Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.

VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.

Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.",online law enforcement

The dashcam that sends Safetygrams™, as you drive!

Safetygrams are brief videos that document unsafe events on the roadways, like aggressive driving. By default, they are visible to everyone, including law enforcement and insurance companies.

Just mount your device to your dashboard, start recording, and go for a drive. See something unsafe? Tap the screen 3 times! (You can also use a voice command.)

The app will instantly broadcast a Safetygram, which starts about 15 seconds in the past, and is 30 seconds total. That means it automatically captures the beginning, middle, and end of each event - while your eyes stay on the road!

Safetygrams are broadcast and displayed on www.busycop.com. Each Safetygram includes video, audio, GPS location, and speed (optional).

Despite the name, ""Safetygrams"" can also be used to document illegal (or just plain annoying) behaviors on the road.

Great for these situations:

◦ Aggressive driving
◦ Distracted driving
◦ Stoplight violations
◦ Defective vehicles
◦ Loose/insecure cargo
◦ Encroaching on pedestrians/bicyclists
◦ HOV lane abuse
◦ Nuisance vehicles
◦ Littering/illegal dumping
◦ ...and more!

BusyCop Dashcam can record in the background, while your favorite navigation/music app stays up front.

You can also ""manually upload"" selected portions of your drive (once your commute is over).

Use this app to defend yourself: Against liability, road rage, and distracted drivers!

Use it to protect others: Our online database (www.busycop.com) provides useful analytics for law enforcement, insurance companies, and the general public.

Don't be a victim! Help stop unsafe situations, before someone gets hurt.

We focus on alternative payment channels such as banks, mobile payments, ATM’s, and brick-and-mortar payment centers. By doing so, we provide our merchant's convenience, better protection against fraud, and low transaction fees.

Online Payment Collection

Everybody believes e-commerce will be a major force in retail. The challenge remains in developing countries like the Philippines where the main mode of payment is still cash. With a population of over 100M, the estimated number of Filipinos with credit cards only stands at 5%. It is also estimated that only about 20% to 25% of the population at most have a bank account. How do you get these potential buyers with no credit cards to shop online?

Dragonpay solves the problem by extending the online world to the physical world. Customers can buy online from e-commerce merchants and fulfill the payment through non-credit card channels. We currently support online banking of most of the major local commercial banks, physical ATM payments, over-the-counter (OTC) cash payments at banks and retail establishments (supermarkets, groceries, department stores, courier centers, remittance centers). Merchants are provided with a single, unified Application Programming Interface (API) to accept payments from any supported source.",e-commerce fraud

Who is Joe the Web Guy?

Joe Levi, known to his friends as Joe the Web Guy, is a web geek and CSS guru with 17 years' experience in web development; HTML markup; styling with CSS; and enhancing user experiences with javascript, jquery, HTML5, CSS3, and more!

He was hired by his current employer to fill the position of Web Application Developer left vacant by their previous Web Developer. Previously Joe worked for an advertising agency as their interactive Technology Director, and developed projects for clients such as 3M HIS, Novell, 3COM, and Sundance Resort. He performed contract work for a local dot com, building their first B2C e-commerce shopping cart solution. He even worked for a local pseudo-celebrity (Dell ""SUPERDELL"" Schanze) where he wore many hats (including Sharepoint Developer and various technical and management positions).

Joe was a Web of Trust Notary, endorsed by Thawte (a Verisign company), and experienced with x.590 Digital Signature Certificates. Joe believes in the widespread use of PKI Encryption technologies and methodologies as potentially being the ""magic bullet"" in eliminating online fraud, identity theft, and even casual snooping.

Give Joe a pair of headphones and a can of anything ""cold and caffeinated"" and he can code for hours on end. He can work efficiently as a solo developer and is also at-home when working as part of a development team.

When asked, Joe tells people that it's not really that he knows all that much, rather that he's just really good at figuring things out.

In the years since Joe began his employment with his current employer, he has been instrumental in realizing several projects and keeps existing sites and solutions up-to-date and running smoothly.

Although Joe can work inside the constraints and scope of a project, he has a hard time ""thinking inside the box"" and can often see the larger picture and offer ideas, thoughts, or ""what-if"" scenarios that can help ""future-proof"" a given project to extend the value and business-returns.",e-commerce fraud

Concerns of an Online Shopper

Though online shopping is fun and convenient it has got its own negative shades. Because of which many online shoppers are reluctant towards online shopping. At Vizag Market we are keen to address these concerns and shall endeavor to make online shopping a trustworthy shopping channel. 

We have identified that the following are few major concerns of an online shopper. 
Fraud Sellers: Few online shoppers have experienced this. Customers have received dummy products instead of the one showcased in the website.
Inferior Quality: We often hear customers complaining about receiving inferior quality products to that of the one shown in the website.
Color Deviation: Another major concern of an online shopper is deviation in color especially in garments to what’s shown to what received. 
At Unipop Impex Pvt Ltd we have done an analysis study and arrived at a view point that the above mentioned concerns are due to the type of E-commerce model that has been widely used i.e. MULTI-SELLER system.
Multi-Seller system is the most widely used E-commerce models by all major E-commerce giants in market today.
In Multi-Seller system, several sellers use a selling platform of third party provider to sell their products. In this case the E-commerce website operators have no control on the quality of the products sold by the seller. Therefore sellers might exploit this freehandedness and tend to sell products which are different from the one showcased.

WHY US

After thorough analysis and research, we at Unipop Impex Pvt Ltd have decided to follow and implement an e-commerce model which is different to the above and could win the trust of the customers. 
Multi-Supplier Model
Finally we chose to implement Multi-Supplier system e-commerce model for www.vizagmarket.com which is pretty much fool proof in all aspects. 
In Multi-Supplier E-commerce model the website owner will have the complete control of the product including price and quality. In this model the website owner handpicks quality products from different manufacturers and showcases it to customers after a through quality check.
Local E-Commerce
Unipop Impex Pvt Ltd has introduced first of its kind Local E-commerce model through Vizag Market. Though Vizag Market is equipped with Nationwide Delivery Network, we introduced Local E-commerce feature with an intention to make local online shopping more fun and convenient. 
• Customers get to shop products and get delivered within 1 working day
• Customers can shop online pick up and pay at the store directly
• Easy Returns and Exchanges within no time
Value for Money Shopping
We call it ‘Value for Money Shopping’ for a reason. Its something which makes us stand out. It’s the ‘Factory Outlet Pricing’. At www.vizagmarket.com we procure quality products from top rated manufacturers and present it to customers at a pricing very competitive from showrooms and shops.
The Factory Outlet Pricing helps us to win the trust of all sectors of customers thereby attracting more customers rather a few sectors. 
At Unipop Impex Pvt Ltd we are keen to implement any cutting edge technology to make E-commerce as customer friendly as possible. For the same reason we make seamless efforts to research and hear customer’s view point so that we can mould ourselves accordingly.

Card-like behavior simulates the same and exact user experience as for real physical contactless card. Flexible behavior utilizes flexibility of the on-device authentication mechanisms (PIN, fingerprint, pattern, face recognition, …) and is additionally secured with on device risk management specified by the MasterCard. Flexible and card-like behavior is step forward compared to the previous MasterCard specification where Mobile PIN was required for each and every transaction.

Payment is performed by tapping mobile device to a contactless POS terminal reader or when it comes to e-commerce and m-commerce transactions, by simplified “in-app” payment.

Physical cards are being virtualized through tokenization and digitization processes. Tokenization stands for assigning DPANs of virtual cards to real PAN of physical card.

Build Trust.

Advertise Honestly.

Tell the Truth.

Be Transparent.

Honor Promises: Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations. 

Be Responsive: Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedlinesolutions.payatthedoor&referrer=utm_source%3D42matters.com%26utm_medium%3Dapi,"SpeedLine Pay@ the Door gives your delivery customers added convenience and payment security, while at the same time saving you money. Because the customer pays in person at the door, you pay lower card-present processing fees, and reduce liability for fraudulent delivery chargebacks.
Depending on order volume and delivery area, with EMV payment at the door, a restaurant with delivery could save hundreds of dollars every month in reduced card processing rates.
The savings apply even to e-commerce orders. When used with a compatible e-commerce system such as SpeedDine, online order payments for deliveries are processed at the door as well, at the same lower card-present rates. With online ordering representing a growing percentage of many delivery operations’ sales, that means significant savings and risk reduction. 
Features:
• Mobile EMV PIN pad allows tap payments, and prompts for a driver tip.
• Validated against the current version of PA-DSS for PCI compliance.
• Customer payment card details are encrypted and tokenized at the door, and EMV employed for optimal payment security and fraud protection.
• Accepts multiple payments.
• Scans a QR code for fast payment amount and ticket entry.
Example Usage:
• Customers order over the phone or online.
• The driver takes the mobile device with the app (usually a smartphone) and a paired EMV PIN pad on the delivery run.
• The driver scans a QR code on the printed ticket, or enters the ticket and payment amount into the Pay@ the Door app on the phone.
• The app securely communicates with the PIN pad to send payment information.
• The customer completes the payment by following prompts on the PIN pad.
• The completed payment and tip info is securely sent to the Pay@ the Door app.
• The payment is sent to Vantiv Express.
• The app indicates whether the payment was authorized successfully, and for how much.
• The driver gives the customer their food.
• After the driver returns to the store, the SpeedLine POS retrieves authorization details and emails the customer a receipt.
Requirements:
• A mobile iOS or Android device with cellular data for every driver on shift.
• A supported Bluetooth EMV PIN pad paired to the mobile device for every driver on shift.
• Integrated payment card processing with Vantiv Express and triPOS Mobile.
• Pay@ the Door is only available in the US.
• If used for online orders, your restaurant's online ordering provider must support Pay@ the Door.",e-commerce fraud

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.gotelee.guardian&referrer=utm_source%3D42matters.com%26utm_medium%3Dapi,"Overview

Gotelee Guardian is a product safety due diligence app for electrical equipment, machinery / power tools, toys and cosmetics.

The app assists those in e-commerce distribution, eg. Fulfilment Houses and warehouse keepers, to comply with their product safety obligations. 

In short, these are to take all reasonable steps and exercise all due diligence to check products and prevent unsafe products leaving the premises.

By following the app’s simple series of steps, Fulfilment Houses and warehouse keepers can identify products in their possession which do not comply with product safety requirements.

The app generates an audit trail to show that a product safety due diligence check has been completed on a specific date and time. A generated report enables the Fulfilment House and warehouse keeper to then take appropriate action to ensure that unsafe products do not leave the premises.

How it works

On First Use

The app user enters an email address. The generated product safety reports will then be sent to this email address. This may be the email address of the nominated compliance manager. The email address can be changed at any time.

Product Checking

1. The app user enters the product’s SKU number and a short description of the product.

2. The app user then selects the product type (electrical equipment, or machinery / power tools, or toys, or cosmetics).

3. The app user answers a short series of questions about the product.

A photo of the product can be taken by the app user at any stage. This is automatically linked to the answers.

Product Safety Reports

The app produces an on-screen report for the app user. The report confirms either 'Due Diligence Pass' or 'Quarantine'. 

The app user can then take immediate action to store the products in the appropriate section of the warehouse.

If the result is 'Quarantine' the on-screen report highlights the identified product safety problem(s).

The app user is prompted to email the report. 

The report contains the SKU number, product description, answers to the questions and any photos, and confirms the overall result ('Due Diligence Pass' or 'Quarantine'). 

Upon emailing the report, the app is cleared of data, ready for the next product check.

Audit Trail

The emailing of the report provides a clear documented audit trail to confirm that a product safety due diligence check has been completed on a specific date and time. 

Taking Further Action

If the result is 'Quarantine’, the report contains a link to an FAQs page to assist the compliance manager in deciding upon the further action to be taken. 

The compliance manager can send the report to the customer, so that the problem is clear to all.

Disclaimer and App Limitations

Use of this app does not:

1. Provide absolute confirmation that a product is safe. A product may display the correct safety related information but could still have a fault which renders it unsafe; or

2. Mean that you have fully complied with all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence in relation to a particular product; or

3. Mean that you have entered into a retainer with Gotelee Solicitors for professional services.

You are responsible for checking for updates and updating this app.

Limitations of Liability

A. Subject to paragraphs B and C below, Gotelee Solicitors’ liability to you arising out of or in connection with your use of this app shall be limited to £2 million.

B. Subject to paragraph C below, Gotelee Solicitors will not be liable for any consequential, special, indirect or exemplary damages, costs or losses or any damages, costs or losses attributable to lost profits or opportunities arising out of or in connection with your use of this app.

C. Gotelee Solicitors only limits its liability to the extent the law allows. In particular, Gotelee Solicitors does not limit its liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.",e-commerce fraud

Concerns of an Online Shopper

Though online shopping is fun and convenient it has got its own negative shades. Because of which many online shoppers are reluctant towards online shopping. At Vizag Market we are keen to address these concerns and shall endeavor to make online shopping a trustworthy shopping channel. 

We have identified that the following are few major concerns of an online shopper. 
Fraud Sellers: Few online shoppers have experienced this. Customers have received dummy products instead of the one showcased in the website.
Inferior Quality: We often hear customers complaining about receiving inferior quality products to that of the one shown in the website.
Color Deviation: Another major concern of an online shopper is deviation in color especially in garments to what’s shown to what received. 
At Unipop Impex Pvt Ltd we have done an analysis study and arrived at a view point that the above mentioned concerns are due to the type of E-commerce model that has been widely used i.e. MULTI-SELLER system.
Multi-Seller system is the most widely used E-commerce models by all major E-commerce giants in market today.
In Multi-Seller system, several sellers use a selling platform of third party provider to sell their products. In this case the E-commerce website operators have no control on the quality of the products sold by the seller. Therefore sellers might exploit this freehandedness and tend to sell products which are different from the one showcased.

WHY US

After thorough analysis and research, we at Unipop Impex Pvt Ltd have decided to follow and implement an e-commerce model which is different to the above and could win the trust of the customers. 
Multi-Supplier Model
Finally we chose to implement Multi-Supplier system e-commerce model for www.vizagmarket.com which is pretty much fool proof in all aspects. 
In Multi-Supplier E-commerce model the website owner will have the complete control of the product including price and quality. In this model the website owner handpicks quality products from different manufacturers and showcases it to customers after a through quality check.
Local E-Commerce
Unipop Impex Pvt Ltd has introduced first of its kind Local E-commerce model through Vizag Market. Though Vizag Market is equipped with Nationwide Delivery Network, we introduced Local E-commerce feature with an intention to make local online shopping more fun and convenient. 
• Customers get to shop products and get delivered within 1 working day
• Customers can shop online pick up and pay at the store directly
• Easy Returns and Exchanges within no time
Value for Money Shopping
We call it ‘Value for Money Shopping’ for a reason. Its something which makes us stand out. It’s the ‘Factory Outlet Pricing’. At www.vizagmarket.com we procure quality products from top rated manufacturers and present it to customers at a pricing very competitive from showrooms and shops.
The Factory Outlet Pricing helps us to win the trust of all sectors of customers thereby attracting more customers rather a few sectors. 
At Unipop Impex Pvt Ltd we are keen to implement any cutting edge technology to make E-commerce as customer friendly as possible. For the same reason we make seamless efforts to research and hear customer’s view point so that we can mould ourselves accordingly.

Have you ever wondered if there are ghosts in your house? In your office? In your car? Well... there probably are not any. Who knows. 

But imagine if an app could actually scan for something like that? Well, all those apps you may have seen are actually in reality very limited, as mobile device hardware doesn't typically have the kind of sensors you see on modern ghost scanning equipment. But don't let that stop you from having fun!

Go ahead and give this app a try - it has interesting and unique features that will both entertain and create an interesting discussion with friends.

Download Real Radar For Ghosts, and prepare to be impressed. It isn't like those other Ghost Radar apps that you may have seen on the app store. It has features many other competitor apps do not offer!

Show your friends, get them to compare side-by-side this application on your device, and at the same time on their own device, and prepare to have your mind blown.

DISCLAIMER: While this app is compelling, it features some experimental features which most apps would never tell you about, because they are all almost certainly fake! The app uses technology that is not normally put to use on an ordinary mobile device, and is often only seen available on standalone devices with dedicated magnetic sensors and an array of other common ghost hunting sensors. 

THIS APP however, does use state-of-the-art detection visualization techniques which are impossible to prove in a scientific environment, obviously. When you use this app, your using it at your own risk - and that means you SHOULD NEVER EVER use this app while your driving a vehicle, operating heavy machinery, or if you are just really paranoid. It also means you absolutely should not depend on the results of this app in a court of law as they have no proven scientific data, but are made for entertainment purposes only.
Questions? Feedback? Absolutely hate this app? Write to the support email - note that at high volume times not all emails can be replied to that are not critical, but replies can sometimes be as soon as the same day. 

<<< CRITICAL: Please read below for some commonly asked questions, and answers about the ""Real"" series of apps >>>

- COMMON QUESTIONS ANSWERED:
QUESTION: How do you use this app? -----------
ANSWER: This is fully explained by just reading the text scrolling inside the app, but the basics are fairly simple, you just watch the radar display, and wait for sounds and ""Blips"" to appear on the radar display. Information will be shown on the right side of the screen, and indicate which ""Blip"" is which.
QUESTION: Is it magic? -----------
ANSWER: No it is not magic. The complete explanation of how the app works is more or less a trade secret - but no, unfortunately it runs on only the magic of computer code, and simply is not capable of supernatural things.
QUESTION: Does it really work? -----------
ANSWER: It really works for what it was designed to do, which is just be an app on your device that displays only entertainment based information, and it is up to the user to distinguish that information and make sense of it.
QUESTION: Can I suggest a feature? -----------
ANSWER: Absolutely! Submit a review to explain. Not every single feature can be included, but all will be considered.

Audio Forensic Analysis Tools

Funded by National Science Foundation and approved by Institutional Review Board of
Oakland University and University of Michigan, this study aims to assist in developing
platform to detect digital forgery detection (e.g. deep fake).

What is this research study About?

The goal of this study is to develop a database for researchers to access in order to
evaluate existing and create new audio forensic algorithms. Forensic algorithms can
help scientists and law enforcement officials identify instances of digital forgery (e.g.
deep fake). To achieve this goal, we seek to collect audio data (background noise or
human speech samples) from a diverse set of adult participants using different types of
smart phones using Audio Forensic Analysis App. We developed our Audio Forensic
Analysis App for two main mobile phone platforms iOS and Android. Study participants
can download our Audio Forensic Analysis App from App Store (iPhone/iPad), Google
Play (Android), and project webpage.

To participate in this important scientific project, install the “Audio Forensic” application
on your smart phone. In case, you need further assistance to install the application, see
following help page: http://www.secs.oakland.edu/~Mahmood/apps/install.html
Installed app will be used for uploading audios to our secure database server.
Recordings can be pre-recorded audio files from the cell phone or new audio
recordings. Participants are highly encouraged to record samples in different ambience
(different noise level in surroundings) settings and can consist of environment sounds or
human speech without any personal identifying information.

Compensation

Data collection will take about 45 min to record and upload the 8 audio files each 5
minutes in length. Upon completion participants will receive a one-time compensation in
the form of a $20 electronic gift card.

Who can participate? 

Participants in the research should meet following criteria:
- Can speak English. To have diverse collection of audios, native English
speakers, minorities and international students are encouraged to participate.
- Only individuals 18 years of age or older can participate.
- Minimum of high school education is required to participate in this study.
- Both male and female students are encouraged to participate in this study.
- Resides in the US

* No tracking needed. App auto tracks your abstinence time. 

The Habit breaking consists of 3 easy steps:

1. You take a photo of your bad habit - like cigarette for smoking, or candy for candies obsession, or smartphone for online time waste and etc.
2. You add a title for bad habit. 
3. You launch breaking process - this way habit photo gradually is processed and is placed into bad habits bin. (here we use here a scientific NLP method of changing perception of bad habit to break completely).

After you added and broke new habit, you can always track your garbage bin and see the abstinence time of the bad habit. 

You can get also profit calculation in Pro version.

if you accidentally reverted to a bad habit - you can reset it and start tracking again. 

That's easy and simple because the power is at your heart - the app only unlocks it, so no need to use all these complex habit tracking apps, complete 26 steps of instructions or use hypnosis and other mind f*ing crap. 

Scientific explanation for those who love details:
Usually the habit loop consists of 3 parts:

Trigger (stress from a work)
Routine (eat a cookie)
Reward (stress relief in short term, but ruining the health in long term)

In more clear words:
Trigger = Feeling bad.
Routine = doing something to feel good.
Reward = feel good. but ruining life in long term.

In Habits Bin we just bent the Reward part to enjoy another things, so the loop is doomed to fail. Because Trigger is not compelling now as it was before.",cookie tracking

• You can even track & locate Android tablets, or an iPad

We’ve been developing our GPS technology for over 5 years, making our app the most accurate mobile cell tracker you can find! 


Note: For the tracking feature to function, the app must be installed on the iPhone or Droid you’re looking for. Once you’ve installed the app on your iPhone, or Android Phone, simply log into our website. You’ll see a pin on the map showing the location of your phone. The map also features directions to the device’s exact location. Another key feature is real time updates on both the app and our website. You’ll see the map instantly updated whenever the device moves.

We are very grateful for all users who are sending crash reports with nice comments how they got to it. It really helps us fix the problems and it should not take a lot of your time to write how you think the crash occurred (and why).

FAQ:
During last few months I have received few questions that sounded same and below is a short list. If you have any questions/suggestions feel free to mail me, but please mention that you are writing for GMC application. 

Q: Why does application request CAMERA premissions?
A: Because camera enables you to scan the QR code and save yourself a hassle of typing the long api key

Q: Is application and data transfer secure?
A: Nothing is perfectly secure in this world (not even https), but application still uses https to transfer most sensitive data. However our application does not require any passwords to access information it displays, so most information is public anyway.

Q: Where can I request feature or report a bug?
A: Please visit the application forum thread on give-me-coins.com https://forum.give-me-coins.com/discussion/222/android-pool-watcher-app/ or on github (link above)

Q: Application is running slow - what should I do?
A: Please be so kind and report any performance issues as bugs. Last thing we want to do is a slow app that uses a lot of resources.

Q: How much data transfer does application require?
A: Application receives text, so data size is not huge, but keep in mind it updates currencies as well as pool data beside your user data. So far none of our users complained, but we have ability to implement some sort of restrictions if needed (requested).

Q: Where do I get API Key?
A: Please go to give-me-coins.com website, login to your account and there you can see the API KEY along with the QR Code. Either scan QR code or write the key into the app to enable data exchange between pool and application.",website monitoring

As this is an open-source project, you can either buy the factory assembled official OVMS car module, or, build yourself one with off the shelf components. Find out more about the OVMS car module (USD99) on our project website: http://www.openvehicles.com/

Open Vehicle Monitoring System

Why?
We are a group of enthusiasts who want an interface to be able to talk to our cars remotely, perhaps add on-car displays (such as heads-up speed), and we want to have fun doing it.

What is it?
The Open Vehicle Monitoring System is three things:
1. A low-cost open-source module that fits in the car (available on the OVMS site). It is powered by the car, talks to the car on the CAN bus, and uses the GSM cellular network to talk to its user.
2. A server (provided by the OVMS project). The car module can be configured to either talk to the server (via UDP/IP or TCP/IP over the Internet) or the user directly (via SMS).
3. A cellphone App (this app). This talks to the server (via TCP/IP HTTP protocol) to retrieve messages from the car and issue instructions.

Management in businesses and organizations is the function that coordinates the efforts of people to accomplish goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively.

Management includes planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization to accomplish the goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. Management is also an academic discipline, a social science whose objective is to study social organization.

Management involves identifying the mission, objective, procedures, rules and the manipulation of the human capital of an enterprise to contribute to the success of the enterprise. This implies effective communication: an enterprise environment (as opposed to a physical or mechanical mechanism), implies human motivation and implies some sort of successful progress or system outcome. 

As such, management is not the manipulation of a mechanism (machine or automated program), not the herding of animals, and can occur in both a legal as well as illegal enterprise or environment.Management does not need to be seen from enterprise point of view alone, because management is an essential function to improve one's life and relationships. Management is there everywhere and it has a wider range of application. Based on this, management must have humans, communication, and a positive enterprise endeavor. Plans, measurements, motivational psychological tools, goals, and economic measures (profit, etc.) may or may not be necessary components for there to be management. At first, one views management functionally, such as measuring quantity, adjusting plans, meeting goals. This applies even in situations where planning does not take place. From this perspective, Henri Fayol (1841–1925) considers management to consist of six functions:

Forecasting
Planning
Organizing
Commanding
Coordinating
Controlling
Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely:

financial management
human resource management
information technology management (responsible for management information systems)
marketing management
operations management or production management
strategic management

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
We believe in the freedom of expression and that everyone’s thoughts should be heard with open minds and hearts. There are many independent film makers and show creators who do not have a platform to broadcast their creations – we are giving them the opportunity to change that.

There is a large audience hungry for this content who currently resort to pirate channels, making do with inferior quality and the stigma of viewing illegal content. Through our technology and non-skippable advertising, we have created a revenue model that provides a superior viewing experience, generates a bigger platform for quality media and supports the further development of the Indian film industry.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRODUCERS
Media producers can release their web series, shows and movies with Indian Movie Friend. We can provide a platform with global reach and minimal up-front costs, providing an opportunity to generate well deserved revenue.

Freedom of Expression - no blocks, flags or content censoring
Security - proven technology that prevents piracy
Cost effective - no upfront costs for a global release

TECHNOLOGICAL SECURITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Protection of the IPR of the broadcast media is at the heart of our operation. We have technology that ensures the end-user cannot download or otherwise record the movies on their device. We can also control the geographic area where the movies are to be streamed, which provides producers with options for a variable release schedule and advertisers with options for tailored and targeted sales messages.

Movies are secured with DRM, invisible user-based forensic watermarking and encryption. Users are authenticated by device and location verification. Using the forensic marking, the viewer is tagged with a unique identification in the invisible mode. The non-removable identifier is imperceptible to the viewer and is embedded in the video enabling us to trace any content breach.",illegal advertising

Lightcatch is a revolutionary new app that protects communities and lets everyone with a smartphone help the police stop crime 10X faster and more effectively than anything else on the market. 
In 2018, a test run of the system in Grande Prairie, Alberta area met with huge success. Thousands got involved, and together they helped recover over $1.2 million of stolen goods - including 33 stolen vehicles, and priceless items like a father’s ashes. 

What is Lightcatch?

Lightcatch is a crime reporting tool. Whenever someone witnesses a crime, or catches illegal activity on video, they can upload all the information to the app, which notifies everyone nearby of what happened, and also sends the information to the police, helping them resolve the case faster and more efficiently than ever before. 

Why It works

When you download the app, it serves as a warning to criminals that they are being watched by everyone in your area. Like cockroaches when the lights are turned on, criminals run for it when they know their crimes might be posted online or the police might arrive any moment. With the app, everyone with a mobile phone can help show law enforcement a suspect’s exact location, so they can act with precision and speed.

What it means to you

The more friends, neighbors, and coworkers that have the app, the better your protection becomes. We've seen dramatic decreases in crime, because perpetrators don't want their actions posted online for everyone to see. Whether or not you ever report a crime in the app, it gives you added protection to your home, family, and business. 

Reporting an incident

*Step 1: Upload Crime Info*
When a theft or crime occurs at your home or business, use the Lightcatch website to upload security camera footage (here).* *You can also* *use the app to upload photos and information if the crime was captured on a smartphone.
*Step 2: Get Help*
Every app user in the surrounding area is notified of the incident and can add information and photos, helping create a trail of evidence for the police.
*Step 3: Sleep Soundly*
The police solve cases faster, you get your stolen goods back, and the whole community becomes safer as criminal realize that there’s nowhere to hide.

Data Security

We don’t sell advertising or mine our users data for personal information. You can sleep soundly knowing our team and company live by complete integrity in all we do. 

Stay safe

Don’t wait for someone to steal something near you. Download Lightcatch today as a warning to criminals - that they’ll be watched, located, and caught red-handed. 
Keep crime out of your neighborhood before it happens. Help the police solve it faster if it does. Be proactive in protecting yourself, your family, and your business.

Resolve to increase your business connections this year: Marijuana is now the nation's fastest-growing industry. The legal marijuana industry brought in $2.4 billion last year, so it's certainly no longer any sort of laughing matter. That figure represents an increase of a whopping 74 percent in one year's time, and, over the next five years, the marijuana industry is expected to continue to grow, with ArcView predicting that 14 more states will legalize recreational marijuana and two more states will legalize medical marijuana. At least 10 states are already considering legalizing recreational marijuana in just the next two years through ballot measures or state legislatures. To date, four states -- Colorado, Washington, Alaska and Oregon -- have legalized retail marijuana. Washington, D.C., voters also legalized recreational marijuana use, but sales currently remain banned. Twenty-three states have legalized medical cannabis. Still, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. The report projects that, by 2019, all of the state-legal marijuana markets combined will make for a potential overall market worth almost $11 billion annually.

This guide is all about creating connections — whether say you are a dispensary, an equipment manufacturer in the industry, or an accountant or legal expert looking to provide support services, this directory will help improve your visibility, reach and retention throughout the US and abroad, while ensuring that prospective customers can easily find your business so that everyone can locate the quality cannabis products, services and partners they need.

Available online, on mobile apps and on self-updating CDs & USBs, the USA Cannabis Directory is a dynamic, social-media enabled and searchable directory, designed to provide maximum visibility. We encourage you to use it as a connection to your next customer — and we encourage you to reciprocate by doing business with fellow cannabis companies appearing in this publication.

The directory is distributed via our extensive network, reaching the increasingly growing cannabis community, with both local and non-local consumers and businesses who turn to the USA Cannabis Directory for information about doing business and use it to reach new retailers and partners. The directory is open and freely accessible to the general public, including the states who already have legalized retail marijuana: 7+ million residents of Washington state, 5+ million residents of Colorado, 4 million residents of Oregon and close to 1 million residents of Alaska.

Information about the Cheetah:
The cheetah /ˈtʃiːtə/ (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae that occurs mainly in eastern and southern Africa and a few parts of Iran. The only extant member of the genus Acinonyx, the cheetah was first described by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1775. The cheetah is characterised by a slender body, deep chest, spotted coat, a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, long thin legs and a long spotted tail. Its lightly built, slender form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of the big cats, making it more similar to the cougar. The cheetah reaches nearly 70 to 90 cm (28 to 35 in) at the shoulder, and weighs 21–72 kg (46–159 lb). Though taller than the leopard, it is notably smaller than the lion. Typically yellowish tan or rufous to greyish white, the coat is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots.
Cheetahs are active mainly during the day, with hunting their major activity. Adult males are sociable despite their territoriality, forming groups called ""coalitions"". Females are not territorial; they may be solitary or live with their offspring in home ranges. Carnivores, cheetah mainly prey upon antelopes and gazelles. They will stalk their prey to within 100–300 metres (330–980 ft), charge towards it and kill it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. The cheetah's body is specialised for speed; it is the fastest land animal. The speed of a hunting cheetah averages 64 km/h (40 mph) during a sprint; the chase is interspersed with a few short bursts of speed, when the animal can attain 112 km/h (70 mph), although this is disputed by more recent measurements. Cheetahs are induced ovulators, breeding throughout the year. Gestation is nearly three months long, resulting in a litter of typically three to five cubs (the number can vary from one to eight). Weaning occurs at six months; siblings tend to stay together for some time. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other mammals, especially in the Serengeti region. Cheetahs inhabit a variety of habitats – dry forests, scrub forests and savannahs.
Thanks to its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed and used to kill game at hunts in the past. The animal has been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising and animation.
Classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the cheetah has suffered a substantial decline in its historic range due to rampant hunting in the 20th century. Several African countries have taken steps to improve the standards of cheetah conservation. By late 2016-early 2017, the cheetah's global population had fallen to approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild due to habitat loss, poaching, the illegal pet trade, and conflict with humans, with researchers suggesting that the animal be immediately reclassified as ""Endangered"" on the IUCN Red List.",illegal advertising
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=scr.avgspdcamapp&referrer=utm_source%3D42matters.com%26utm_medium%3Dapi,"Welcome to !TASCA (The Average Speed Camera App)

!TASCA has been designed specifically for use where there are Average Speed Cameras and has features not found on other apps.

!TASCA does what it says and nothing else (there is no product advertising, no in-app purchases, no gathering of your personal data).

!TASCA works entirely within the phone** and does not send or receive data via network or WiFi. There are therefore no network charges and the app works even if no SIM card is fitted.

!TASCA can operate automatically (hands-free) using databases. !TASCA includes databases for these 4 average speed camera systems:

1, A40 (London)
2, A406 (North Circular)
3, A316 (W London)
4, M4 (London)

!TASCA can be used to create your own databases for other average speed camera systems (the databases are simple text files that you can open, read, edit and share).

BASIC OPERATION:

AS = Average Speed

After passing each AS camera, !TASCA starts measuring your AS. This is displayed on the screen with a background that is:

1) green (if AS is below the speed limit)
2) amber (if AS is below the NIP threshold)
3) red (if AS is above the NIP threshold)

You can select an audio voice message* if AS goes above a threshold (adjustable).

!TASCA has 2 modes: manual and automatic.

MANUAL MODE

The user selects the speed limit and then taps ""Camera"" when passing each AS camera.

AUTOMATIC MODE

Where AS cameras are in your databases, !TASCA operates automatically. The app:

1) searches for AS cameras that are directly ahead and in your direction
2) when within 1 Km, !TASCA ""locks"" to the AS camera and displays information
3) after passing the AS camera, !TASCA resets the AS
4) !TASCA then searches for the next AS camera

When !TASCA ""locks"" to an AS camera, information can include:

1: Name of the camera,
2: Distance to the camera,
3: Countdown (in seconds) to when you are allowed to pass the camera,
4: The speed that will result in your AS at the camera being equal to the speed limit,
5: The speed that will result in your AS at the camera being equal to the NIP threshold.

SAVE JOURNEY DATA

Tap ""Save"" twice to record journey data. The file contains

1: A list of events including the first and last GPS locations between each pair of AS cameras
2: A summary of the sections between AS cameras including distance, time and AS

The journey log is a simple text file that can be read in the standard HTML viewer, or opened on a computer in a notepad or spreadsheet (tab separated).

CREATE YOUR OWN DATABASE:

Suppose you commute through an AS camera system:

On the first journey, operate !TASCA in ""manual"" mode. After the last camera, tap ""Activate new temp database"" twice.

On future commutes, !TASCA will operate automatically using the database you just created.

Note, it may be useful to add other information (such as names that describe each of the new AS cameras etc) and this may best be done on a computer (cannot be done within !TASCA).

You can share your database with others by email etc. Your friends just drop your database into their active database folder and their app can then operate automatically in that AS camera zone.

ACCURACY

A phones GPS and clock should provide more accurate speed readings than your vehicles speedometer or trip computer.

THE LAW

It is illegal to communicate on a hand-held mobile phone while driving. !TASCA should therefore be legal if the phone is in a holder but each user must ensure for themselves that they drive safely and legally at all times.

*Audio voice messages if selected and a voice is installed.

**!TASCA uses the phones:

1) GPS receiver (to determine distance traveled).
2) Clock (to determine time taken).
3) Data storage (to hold databases and save journey logs).",illegal advertising

Management in businesses and organizations is the function that coordinates the efforts of people to accomplish goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively.

Management includes planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization to accomplish the goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. Management is also an academic discipline, a social science whose objective is to study social organization.

Management involves identifying the mission, objective, procedures, rules and the manipulation of the human capital of an enterprise to contribute to the success of the enterprise. This implies effective communication: an enterprise environment (as opposed to a physical or mechanical mechanism), implies human motivation and implies some sort of successful progress or system outcome. 

As such, management is not the manipulation of a mechanism (machine or automated program), not the herding of animals, and can occur in both a legal as well as illegal enterprise or environment.Management does not need to be seen from enterprise point of view alone, because management is an essential function to improve one's life and relationships. Management is there everywhere and it has a wider range of application. Based on this, management must have humans, communication, and a positive enterprise endeavor. Plans, measurements, motivational psychological tools, goals, and economic measures (profit, etc.) may or may not be necessary components for there to be management. At first, one views management functionally, such as measuring quantity, plans, meeting goals. This applies even in situations where planning does not take place. From this perspective, Henri Fayol considers management to consist of six functions:

Forecasting
Planning
Organizing
Commanding
Coordinating
Controlling
Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely:

financial management
human resource management
information technology management (responsible for management information systems)
marketing management
operations management or production management
strategic management

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=zekitez.com.satelliteestimator&referrer=utm_source%3D42matters.com%26utm_medium%3Dapi,"Finding a TV satellite, in azimuth, can be pretty difficult. With this app you do not need a compass, just two (2) GPS locations, from the satellite dish and a target, is enough. Finding the satellite depends on how accurate the GPS locations are (the phone or from Google Earth/Maps) and how accurate and steady you can aim the phone to the target. Read more about the WARNING and how it works.

WARNING: when you are close to or in between walls, roofs, sheds, trees, houses, flats or close to metal the phone's GPS location can be totally wrong which will result in a faulty satellite position !! Your satellite dish and target should be preferably in an 'open space'.

How does it work ? In 3 steps or screens:
1- Select the desired TV satellite
2- The GPS location of the satellite dish and the GPS location of a target (or reference point) is needed. The target can be the GPS location of a house, tree, plant, etc. Just enable the GPS in your phone or enter the GPS locations with the help of Google Earth/Maps (satellite dish position and a visible target position).
To indicate how stable or good the values are they get a color. RED = not good or not stable, YELLOW = better but not good, GREEN = good or stable, CYAN = don't know. To receive good GPS signals you should be in the 'open'. GPS signals can be blocked by buildings, trees, etc and that will result in false GPS locations with an error of several meters while the accuracy is good.
3- Set the dish elevation and skew to the calculated values, see screen 3. The satellite pole must be upright. With the GPS locations set, hold the phone steady above the satellite dish and aim the central arrow named 'target' at the target. Then aim the satellite arm to the arrow named 'satellite'. The success of finding the satellite depends on the accuracy of the phone's GPS and how steady your hands are. KEEP THE PHONE AIMED STEADY AT THE TARGET !!!
Check my instruction movie on 
www.youtube.com (https://youtu.be/o7t9cTVfr1A) or 
at http://home.caiway.nl/~fnijhuis/satloc/index.html . 

When your phone crashes: stop running app's like: Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Badoo, etc. Free up memory of the phone by removing apps you do not use, remove photos and music.

The satellite positions are derived from Agi's database. 
Some positions may seem not accurate (example: Hispasat 30°w is at 29.96°w in the satellite list) but they are very accurate.

If you have any questions, requests or problems PLEASE write an email.

When you click HD button the current wallpaper loads with full resolution.
This smart option allows you to conserve battery power & Internet traffic, also it improves speed of the app.
Honestly, real HD wallpapers are images with huge resolution and important size too ! That means consuming users internet connection and device memory.
BUT ! In similar applications, that's not mentioned at all ! Those apps may be presented as HD applications but in fact when you get in to check pictures quality you may notice that quality is reduced, because if they load tons of photos with high definition quality they risk an abuse of users resources !
DON'T PANIC !
With Open Wallpapers, HD vision is under your request, you can swipe through wallpapers with moderate quality as you like until you found what you are interested in then you can watch it in HD resolution ! Too useful isn't it !?

#SEARCH OPTION:
It's all about tags ! Just type in tags that come to your mind to start searching images.

#PERMISSIONS NOTICE

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.novasolutio.android_en.passguard&referrer=utm_source%3D42matters.com%26utm_medium%3Dapi,"Each of us has a lot of passwords that need to be kept in mind or recorded somewhere. Every program, Internet site, safe, Wi-Fi network, payment card require a password. Writing your passwords in a notebook or in a text file on a computer is inconvenient and outdated. 

On the market play.google.com, there are a lot of different applications for storing passwords for any needs. Some IT companies create an application for storing logins and passwords with a google account synchronization, with an additional extension to the Google Chrome browser. This is quite convenient, but there are as well a number of disadvantages. If someone gets access to this account (for example, uses your laptop), he will automatically be able to save all the data that you have so carefully kept close to the vest. Nova Solutio has developed a cross-functional PassGuard password storage solution - Storing codes and passwords without unnecessary synchronization and uploading the database to the file system or the Internet. Of course, it might be inconvenient when changing phone or tablet to transfer all passwords and logins manually. But this is exactly how you will be sure that no one but you will see these passwords and records.

So, what is the multipurposeness of the PassGuard password manager:
• Ability to enter prompts in case you forgot your password
• Login to the application by fingerprint or after entering the password
• Sending a password to a mail during authorization
• Creating new categories and editing existing
• Grouping passwords into folders
• Capability to change the category of entry
• Creating unique fields for each type of password and login
• Storing PIN code, payment cards (PIN code)
• Editing an entry with recording a time of changing the storage of passwords
• Ability to disable mandatory password entry when entering the application
• An absence of any synchronization or Internet access
• The functionality to share the necessary data from a particular record 
• Creating a password-cleaner which deletes all data when entering the application
• Selecting the number of inputting a false password that closes the application and opens when you click on the PassGuard icon again
• Clearing all data from the application by clicking in the settings ""Delete all""
• No advertising
• PassGuard Password Manager is an absolutely free application.

(You can say thank the developer, having treated him with a cup of coffee, this is a way to tell us ""thank you"" for the work done, and also support the development of new functionality)

VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION

1. Remember well your password to the PassGuard- storing passwords App or send it by mail at the first registration. If you forget your password, the data is IMPOSSIBLE to recover, as the password is the only key to decrypt the encoded data. Our support will not respond to requests for how to recover data if the password is lost or forgotten, simply because data recovery, in this case, is impossible.

2. All logins and passwords are stored ONLY on your phone or tablet, it gives a high guarantee that the data does not fall into the wrong hands, but it also increases your own responsibility for storing codes and passwords.

3. If you have any PROBLEM when using PassGuard - storing passwords App, please write to our support service before leaving a negative comment on Google Play (office@nova-solutio.com). In 99% of cases, all problems can be solved.

Fake news is a type of yellow journalism or propaganda that consists of deliberate misinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional print and broadcast news media or online social media.
This false information is mainly distributed by social media but is periodically circulated through mainstream media.

Fake news is written and published with the intent to mislead in order to damage an agency, entity, or person, and/or gain financially or politically, often using sensationalist, dishonest, or outright fabricated headlines to increase readership, online sharing, and Internet click revenue. In the latter case, it is similar to sensational online ""clickbait"" headlines and relies on advertising revenue generated from this activity, regardless of the veracity of the published stories.

Intentionally misleading and deceptive fake news differs from obvious satire or parody, which is intended to amuse rather than mislead its audience.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.all_things_android.colorblind.free&referrer=utm_source%3D42matters.com%26utm_medium%3Dapi,"The Colorblind Simulator application simulates colorblindness for Protanopia (red), Deuteranopia (green), Tritanopia (blue), and the four forms of Monochromatic colorblindness. While commonly used, the terms red, green, and blue are misleading. The three types of cones actually respond to a range of colors, with red, green, and blue being the approximate peak response wavelengths. Colorblind simulation is not about the generated colors, it is about simulating the same color confusion as experienced by humans with Color Vision Deficiency (CVD).

Rather than using one undefined model, Colorblind Simulator Pro is the only application that allows you to select one of four different models for simulation of CVD. Colorblind Simulator Free uses the default model. All models used are based on open source code. For older versions Android, sRGB was the only color space. Starting with Android Oreo, the app supports all color spaces supported by Android. For some models simulation is done in the sRGB color space.

All models used in the Colorblind Simulator Pro app were tested using an automated version of the Farnsworth-Munsell D-15 Dichromatic Panel test. The objective was to determine if a simulation model generated responses that mimicked the same confusion as humans responses to the test.

The models provided in Pro are:

1) Meyer-Greenberg-Wolfmaier-Wickline (MGWW)
Meyer and Greenberg published their study in 1988. Wolfmaier wrote a Java applet in 1999. The code used in the app is based on WickLine's revisions in 2001. The responses generated by the MGWW model closely matched human responses under all test conditions.

2) Brettel-Vienot-Mollon (BVM)
The authors performed their study in 1997. The code used in the app is based on the code used in the Gimp photo editor. This model tends to not adequately distinguish between protanopia and deuteranopia. Of all the models, BVM responses were the farthest from human responses. (sRGB only)

3) Machado-Oliveira-Fernandes (MOF)
MOF is the only model that us based on the stages theory of color vision. While based on the BVM model, the test results closely mimic human response. MOF is the only model that provides separate tables for different percentages of CVD. All other models use a generic algorithm. (sRGB only)

4) ImageJ CVD Plug-in (ImageJ)
This plug-in is used in both ImageJ and Vischeck. The plug-in is based on MGWW, but uses precalculated tables. Since it is table driven, it is the fastest model and is the default. (sRGB only)

5) Monochromatic
Based on the sparse information available, this model provides a rough simulation of the gray world experienced by those who suffer from one of the four forms of monochromatic vision: rod, red, green, or blue.

In addition to providing different simulation models, Colorblind Simulator Pro allows you to vary the percentage of CVD. The range is from 0% loss to 100% loss, in steps if 10%. The default is 100%.

The Colorblind Simulator Free version does contain advertisements. The Pro version does not contain advertising.

Simulation is a memory intensive task. While the applications check available memory before starting a simulation, the dynamic nature of memory usage can result in out of memory errors during simulation. This only occurs when simulating images, as every pixel requires transformation.",misleading advertising

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.all_things_android.colorblind&referrer=utm_source%3D42matters.com%26utm_medium%3Dapi,"The Colorblind Simulator application simulates colorblindness for Protanopia (red), Deuteranopia (green), Tritanopia (blue), and the four forms of Monochromatic colorblindness. While commonly used, the terms red, green, and blue are misleading. The three types of cones actually respond to a range of colors, with red, green, and blue being the approximate peak response wavelengths. Colorblind simulation is not about the generated colors, it is about simulating the same color confusion as experienced by humans with Color Vision Deficiency (CVD).

Rather than using one undefined model, Colorblind Simulator Pro is the only application that allows you to select one of four different models for simulation of CVD. Colorblind Simulator Free uses the default model. All models used are based on open source code. All models support sRGB, as Android uses the sRGB color space.

All models used in the Colorblind Simulator Pro app were tested using an automated version of the Farnsworth-Munsell D-15 Dichromatic Panel test. The purpose of the test was to determine if a simulation model generated responses that mimicked the same confusion as humans responses to the test.

The models provided in Pro are:

1) Meyer-Greenberg-Wolfmaier-Wickline (MGWW)
Meyer and Greenberg published their study in 1988. Wolfmaier wrote a Java applet in 1999. The code used in the app is based on WickLine's revisions in 2001. The responses generated by the MGWW model closely matched human responses under all test conditions.

2) Brettel-Vienot-Mollon (BVM)
The authors performed their study in 1997. The code used in the app is based on the code used in the Gimp photo editor. This model tends to not adequately distinguish between protanopia and deuteranopia. Of all the models, BVM responses were the farthest from human responses.

3) Machado-Oliveira-Fernandes (MOF)
MOF is the only model that us based on the stages theory of color vision. While based on the BVM model, the test results closely mimic human response. MOF is the only model that provides separate tables for different percentages of CVD. All other models use a generic algorithm. MOF is the default model.

4) ImageJ CVD Plug-in (ImageJ)
This plug-in is used in both ImageJ and Vischeck. The plug-in is based on MGWW, but uses precalculated tables. Consequently, the model is sensitive to any variation in test conditions.

5) Monochromatic
Based on the sparse information available, this model provides a rough simulation of the gray world experienced by those who suffer from one of the four forms of monochromatic vision: rod, red, green, or blue.

In addition to providing different simulation models, Colorblind Simulator Pro allows you to vary:

1) The gamma to simulate different lighting conditions. The default gamma is 1.0, which is the system gamma. The Pro addition provides a feature that allows the gamma to vary according to the brightness setting.

2) The percentage of CVD. The range is from 0% loss to 100% loss, in steps if 10%. The default is 100%.

The Colorblind Simulator Free version does contain advertisements. The Pro version does not contain any advertising.

Simulation is a memory intensive task. While the applications check available memory before starting a simulation, the dynamic nature of memory usage can result in out of memory errors during simulation. This only occurs when simulating images, as every pixel requires transformation.",misleading advertising

Are you self conscious and afraid to exercise? Do you find yourself eating even when you're not hungry? Our program reduces the seeds of self consciousness and creates a mentality conducive to self-discipline. What would you do if you had less hunger, less compulsive eating, less stress, and more compulsion to exercise and be active? You know you won't let yourself down. Act thinner and you'll be thinner. This is the one.

If you have a weight problem, your mind likely already sees your body as beyond its control. They key to every weight loss success story is there was one ""magic cure"" that users truly believed in. Are all these ""magic cures"" real but only for a select few? No. The common thread in them all is self determination. The key is not finding the magic cure, but creating it within yourself. You can quite literally think yourself thin. Just in the same way Yogis are able to walk on hot coals without being damaged or slow down their own metabolisms to heal from within, you can lose weight based on brain patterns. Think it and you will be it. But thinking it isn't easy for some who have lived with the difficulty of an uncooperative metabolism for so many years. And unfair standards in the media only make it more difficult to appreciate yourself and feel healthy so you can be happy.

The ABSOLUTE most important aspect of weight maintenance is your mindset. If weight loss is something you go into as a battle, looking to defeat your own body through starvation and torturous unnatural dietary supplements (which often damage your digestive system), your body will rebel against you. If you think of weight loss as a burden, and exercise as a chore, you will be dissatisfied and tired before you even start. The only way to get your body to do what you want is to cooperate with it. No one's body wants to be unhealthy and lethargic. Our system teaches you how to love physical activity and keep loving it. A temporary diet yields temporary (if any) results. Don't gain the weight back. Get a new body AND a new mindset!

Using these recordings is easy. Do not focus on your weight, or any negative feelings you may have about your body. Instead, imagine yourself having a healthy body. What would that be like? Don't focus on the negative, but rather use your imagination to think about all the things you'd love to do with your new body. Don't think of words such as ""Weight,"" ""Heavy,"" ""Fat,"" or anything ""Negative."" Use positive terms such as ""Now I have a healthy body,"" and ""I look and feel great."" Think in positive terms about your future, and your new lifestyle.

These recordings are made to assist you with the psychological aspects of weight loss. The distinct array of frequencies helps the brain obtain and maintain both motivation and satisfaction without the need to eat. It helps you cancel out the association of ""food"" being used as an unhealthy emotional fixation. Our recordings do work, and as such you will be able to feel this programmable state within minutes of the very first use.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phrenopolis.colorclocklite&referrer=utm_source%3D42matters.com%26utm_medium%3Dapi,"(Free, ad-supported version.)

This app implements International Color Time, which is a slightly silly but effective standard, intended to eliminate the confusion that accompanies trying to coordinate phone calls or other activities with people who live in other time zones around the world. Instead of trying to figure out what time it is somewhere else and whether we mean five o'clock my time or five o'clock your time, we both use a GLOBAL clock that's the SAME EVERYWHERE, and save ourselves a lot of hassle.

Why bother with this, and why use color, you may ask? If you're unsure, consider this excerpt from the ICT Manifesto:

It's hard to keep track of how many hours the time gap is between where you're standing and where your overseas distributor is located, whether you're speaking in terms of your local time or theirs, and whether to add or subtract the difference when figuring out what your watch should say when you make the call. It's worse if either or both of you happen to be traveling, which is increasingly the case now that we all have cell phones, and the fact that there's also Daylight Saving Time which starts and ends on different days in different countries makes things enormously complicated. Some of us waste a lot of time trying to clarify these details (and then we screw it up anyway).

Wouldn't it be nice, and much simpler, if we could all agree on what time it was, all over the world? At first I thought we should just use unaltered Greenwich Mean Time for everything and call it a day. I'd be all right with that, frankly. Computers do it. The only problem is that we've all become accustomed to having certain numbers line up with certain parts of the day, and having the clock ""roll over"" in the middle of the night (and also at mid-day if you're using the 12-hour system). To move the numbers feels peculiar, and to change them more for some people than for others feels unfair.

This is an inherent problem with any time marking system that uses numbers, or letters, or anything else where there is a hierarchy and a point where you return to the beginning. What would be better is a time marking system that forms a natural loop without feeling like it has any particular beginning or end, and without us having habitual expectations about which part of the cycle lines up with which part of the day. That's where the color wheel comes in.

We can simply decide that at some particular point, the time is ""orange,"" everywhere on the planet. Later on it will be yellow, green, teal, blue, maroon, and so on, and eventually orange again. In my part of the world, people tend to wake up in the blue range, eat lunch around lavender and get off work at orange, but elsewhere it may be that you wake up at yellow and have dinner at purple. Neither seems to make more sense than the other, which is exactly the point. And then if we want to have a phone call, we can arrange to speak at thirty minutes past indigo, and there is no confusion about exactly when that means.

And so I decided to implement this clock, as an arbitrary standard for coordinating time around the globe.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phrenopolis.colorclock&referrer=utm_source%3D42matters.com%26utm_medium%3Dapi,"This app implements International Color Time, which is a slightly silly but effective standard, intended to eliminate the confusion that accompanies trying to coordinate phone calls or other activities with people who live in other time zones around the world. Instead of trying to figure out what time it is somewhere else and whether we mean five o'clock my time or five o'clock your time, we both use a GLOBAL clock that's the SAME EVERYWHERE, and save ourselves a lot of hassle.

Why bother with this, and why use color, you may ask? If you're unsure, consider this excerpt from the ICT Manifesto:

It's hard to keep track of how many hours the time gap is between where you're standing and where your overseas distributor is located, whether you're speaking in terms of your local time or theirs, and whether to add or subtract the difference when figuring out what your watch should say when you make the call. It's worse if either or both of you happen to be traveling, which is increasingly the case now that we all have cell phones, and the fact that there's also Daylight Saving Time which starts and ends on different days in different countries makes things enormously complicated. Some of us waste a lot of time trying to clarify these details (and then we screw it up anyway).

Wouldn't it be nice, and much simpler, if we could all agree on what time it was, all over the world? At first I thought we should just use unaltered Greenwich Mean Time for everything and call it a day. I'd be all right with that, frankly. Computers do it. The only problem is that we've all become accustomed to having certain numbers line up with certain parts of the day, and having the clock ""roll over"" in the middle of the night (and also at mid-day if you're using the 12-hour system). To move the numbers feels peculiar, and to change them more for some people than for others feels unfair.

This is an inherent problem with any time marking system that uses numbers, or letters, or anything else where there is a hierarchy and a point where you return to the beginning. What would be better is a time marking system that forms a natural loop without feeling like it has any particular beginning or end, and without us having habitual expectations about which part of the cycle lines up with which part of the day. That's where the color wheel comes in.

We can simply decide that at some particular point, the time is ""orange,"" everywhere on the planet. Later on it will be yellow, green, teal, blue, maroon, and so on, and eventually orange again. In my part of the world, people tend to wake up in the blue range, eat lunch around lavender and get off work at orange, but elsewhere it may be that you wake up at yellow and have dinner at purple. Neither seems to make more sense than the other, which is exactly the point. And then if we want to have a phone call, we can arrange to speak at thirty minutes past indigo, and there is no confusion about exactly when that means.

And so I decided to implement this clock, as an arbitrary standard for coordinating time around the globe.

(My 4000 characters are about used up – if you want to know why THIS clock is better than OTHER clocks based on color, read the full manifesto at phrenopolis.com (also included in the app for your convenience).

To most people, size does matter. Whatever that means, now I’m talking about tattoos. Here we have provided you info, ideas and designs to take inspiration from, especially when you want to get a tattoo and you have no idea what to get. In terms of sizes, we have provided different categories and ideas for placement.

Tattoos are an art form at the peak of innovation. The art of tattoo celebrates the newwave tattooists and body artists, while doffing our caps to the classic styles that paved the way for the surge of creativity and invention found in contemporary tattoo art. Simple outlines and a limited palette have exploded into watercolours.

We will give you small tattoo ideas and designs with positive meanings. This is especially good for tattoo first timers. We have mentioned it before, if you’re scared that you wouldn’t be able to tolerate the pain, better start with small tattoos, and those who want to keep their tattoos simple or minimalist, a small one is suitable for you.

Tattoos are body art that shows a part of your personality to the rest of the world. However, your tattoos don’t define who you truly are. In today’s world filled with criticism and judgment, people with tattoos are thugs, rebels, weirdo, or a part of a cult. It’s unfair for people with tattoos to go through something like that.

Tattoos are more than what meets the eyes. Tattoos convey hidden messages behind those seemingly meaningless symbols and shapes. Each tattoo has a personal meaning to the person wearing it. There are stories behind every tattoo – stories that may be too personal to share in words.

People should try to understand the meaning behind tattoos so they can appreciate it. It’s such a waste to have artistic body tattoos, yet no one gets the message you are trying to convey. For instance, a simple tattoo holds so much meaning than just simply being an art tattoo. It represents the traits of the person wearing the tattoo. Therefore, you should not judge the person immediately.

And, with the ID Watchdog Mobile App, keeping a pulse on your personal and financial information has never been easier. Your phone travels with you, so you won’t have to worry about missing an alert when you’re on the go.
As an ID Watchdog subscriber, you can access important features right from your phone or tablet to:
• Receive alerts, drill into details immediately, and flag alerts for follow-up.
• Lock or unlock your Equifax® credit report and control who can access your credit report with certain exceptions ¹ 
• Activate an Equifax Child Credit Lock to help you better protect against credit fraud in your child’s name
• Add wallet contents for Dark Web monitoring and quick access in the event of a lost or stolen wallet
• Stay up-to-date on your VantageScore® credit score, and see how it’s trending over time
• Control your ID protection preferences, including alerts and security settings
• Contact Customer Care with one-touch calling 

Catch Activity Early. Resolve Problems Before They Grow.
According to the FTC, “If you spot activity that might result from identity theft or a mistake, you can take steps to resolve the problem before it grows.” Don’t lose alerts in the clutter of your email—receive them on your phone so you can take immediate action if necessary—even when you’re away from your computer.

Equifax Credit Report—You’re in Charge.
Locking an Equifax credit report is an effective way to provide additional protection against unauthorized access and to help stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name.¹ Plus, through your ID Watchdog account, activate a Child Credit Lock for your minor child to help you better protect against credit fraud in your child’s name by creating an Equifax credit report for your child then locking it to prevent access to it by potential lenders and creditors.

We’re Here for You.
Reach a U.S.-based Customer Care Specialist whenever you need help, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. If your identity is stolen, our Certified Identity Theft Risk Management Specialists (CITRMS®) fully manage your case until it is resolved. You’ll also get Identity Theft Insurance that helps pay certain out-of-pocket expenses if you are a victim of identity theft. ²

What You Need to Know.
The credit scores provided are based on the VantageScore® 3.0 model. For three-bureau VantageScore credit scores, data from Equifax®, Experian®, and TransUnion® are used respectively. Any one-bureau VantageScore uses Equifax data. Third parties use many different types of credit scores and are likely to use a different type of credit score to assess your creditworthiness.

¹ Locking your Equifax credit file will prevent access to it by certain third parties. Locking your Equifax credit file will not prevent access to your credit file at any other credit reporting agency. Entities that may still have access to your Equifax credit file include: companies like Equifax Global Consumer Solutions which provide you with access to your credit report or credit score, or monitor your credit file; federal, state, and local government agencies; companies reviewing your application for employment; companies that have a current account or relationship with you, and collection agencies acting on behalf of those whom you owe; for fraud detection purposes; and companies that wish to make pre-approved offers of credit or insurance to you.

- average signal strength (RSSI) during the last few seconds
- Measured Power level; MAC address
- number of RSSI samples received from the beacon over the last few seconds

What's a beacon?
A beacon is a tiny Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy device that can be detected by a compatible smartphone device from up to 50 meters away, without any need to pair or connect to it. Detecting beacons is very battery-friendly, unlike GPS. This allows proximity-aware applications to react differently for each beacon it finds, depending on the beacon and the application.

This application uses our custom Android beacon detection library, which we are working on since 2014. 
Beacon Monitor uses OneBeacon - http://onebeacon.io , our universal beacon platform that can make your app quickly interact with any type of Bluetooth Low Energy beacon.

It can even piggyback on existing apps that are active (like running or cycling apps) to help preserve battery life.

Location sharing in 60 seconds
☆ install Graticule
☆ configure the beacon source and interval
☆ share your private web tracking link
☆ enjoy!



What beacon source should I use?
☆ GPS: best accuracy, bad battery life -- best used outside cities
☆ Network: decent accuracy, decent battery life -- best used inside cities
☆ Passive: variable accuracy, best battery life -- best used when you have another location app already running (like Strava, Runtastic, Waze, Google Maps, etc)



What beacon interval should I use?
As big (less often) as you can.

Even choosing every 5s instead of 1s, when using GPS, makes a tremendous difference in battery life.



Shared your private tracking link with the wrong person?
No problem! 
You can switch to a new one in a matter of seconds.



Features
☆ no registration required
☆ you get a private web tracking link that you can share with anyone (they don't have to have an app installed to view)
☆ the tracking code is disposable, change it any time you want
☆ as easy as possible on battery/data usage
☆ no identifiable information sent from your device
☆ fully secure and encrypted communication
☆ passive mode (piggybacks on other active apps, like running/cycling ones)



What can I do with it?
☆ give peace of mind to your family or loved ones when travelling
☆ showing off while paragliding/flying/skydiving (assuming you still have enough signal for a data connection)
☆ putting a cheap android phone in your car, on your pet, or anywhere else and track it
☆ guide someone remotely to a location
☆ no longer have to answer ""Where are you?"" or ""How far away are you?""



What do I need?
☆ an android device :-)
☆ data connection
☆ GPS or Wi-Fi turned on (depending on what kind of accuracy you need -- precise or approximate)



Mobile data usage?
Mobile data use for a GPS beacon source with a 1 interval update is about 2.70 MB per hour.

Increasing the interval to 2 seconds will halve it, so 1.35 MB per hour.

And so on...



NOTE: You need a data connection (enough cell tower signal) for this to work, it's not a substitute for a PLB/EPIRB radio beacon

The tracklog is NOT saved in this free version, just the last beacon!
You need to get the PRO version if you need the whole tracklog.

Every map displayed once is kept in the device and is available even with no network (off-line mode). All non-topographic maps and most ortophotos stay permanently free.

NEW : since 2017-April-1 the provisional cache licence is included in the IGN annual basic licence.

NEW: FREE world-wide coverage though OpenStreetMap/openCycleMap, Spain, Germany, Italy, Norwey, IGN-littoral, and others new maps from IGN.

This URL can be easily changed remotely with our Platform from BKON Connect, Inc. 

However, if you’re looking for more hardware control over your BKON brand beacon’s settings, including iBeacon or Eddystone configurations from UUID, Major, Minor, Range, and Advertising Interval, to UID Instance or Namespace when within range of your BKON beacons… the BKON Configuration app is what you need. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________

BKON Configuration Directions:
First, be sure Bluetooth is enabled on your smartphone or tablet and when you launch BKON Config, it will automatically begin scanning for beacons in the area.

1.) Place the intended target beacon you want to update immediately next to the smartphone or tablet you’re using and move all other beacons at least an arm’s length away.

2.) Select the target beacon in the area beacons list to retrieve that beacon’s settings. You can use the six character TouchPointID present on the side of your BKON beacon to help identify your desired beacon in the list. The RSSI might also help you find your desired beacon. The closer it is to zero, the closer it is to your device. This may take a few moments.

3.) To confirm you are paired with the correct beacon, tap the “identify” button that looks like a spyglass in the upper right corner. A small light should flash on the top of the beacon. This light will also flash immediately one time when you successfully pair with your beacon. If you do not see a light on the desired beacon, then you have paired with a different beacon. Exit from this pairing by tapping on the arrow in the upper left corner to return to your Area Beacons list. Again, use the phyID present on the side of the beacon and in the app to help with this process. 

4.) Once successfully paired with your desired beacon, tap the field you want to change. (Note for iBeacon users: You can create zones our BeaconRegistry.com site with your major/minor/UUID and then use BKON Config to associate the beacon with that zone.)

5.) Make sure to tap the “Done” button to save your fields after editing. IMPORTANT: Let the app complete writing the new information to the beacon. This may take a few moments.

The Lexington Law app lets you follow your credit repair progress. With access to a variety of tools, you can better understand, improve and protect your credit, from your mobile device.
Lexington Law is an advocate for you, the consumer. We want to make sure your credit is reported fairly and accurately. If you’ve been denied for credit, then let us help you get back on the path to approval.

Credit Repair Services

Unlike other credit repair companies, we obtain your credit reports from all three credit bureaus - Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Then we work with you to establish challenge reasons for each negative item on your report. We send electronic disputes to the bureaus on your behalf and also communicate directly with your creditors.

We're absolutely confident in our proven credit repair process. We've helped successfully remove over 10 million inaccurate, unfair or unsubstantiated negative items from credit reports in 2017 alone. On average our clients see 10.2 negative items or 24% of their presenting negatives, removed within the first 4 months of service.

Note: As all legal cases are different these results should not be expected and are not guaranteed.

FICO® Score

Many of our service levels include a TransUnion FICO® Score to help you keep track of your credit progress. FICO® Scores are involved in 90% of US based lending decisions.

Focus Tracks

Our credit repair services don’t simply dispute every negative item on your credit report like some other companies. Rather we use your input and life experiences to determine how to challenge each negative item. We leverage several laws and consumer protections based on your feedback to achieve results. There are many protections for consumers who’ve gone through a life event that may have affected their credit such as divorce, identity theft, military service, medical bills and mishandled student loans. If you’ve gone through one of these life events then our service is for you.

Credit Reports

When you sign up with our service, we pull your credit reports for all three credit bureaus. We aggregate your credit report items and present them in an easy to understand interface. Your credit report information is then used to dispute and intervene with the credit bureaus and your creditors.

Credit Monitoring

We monitor your credit using a set of credit monitoring alerts called ReportWatch. Our monitoring services not only alert you when something changes on your TransUnion credit report but also gives you information and advice based on the change.

Identity Theft Protection

Lexington Law provides identity theft insurance up to $1MM. In addition, a few of our service levels include a thorough set of identity protection alerts and monitoring services that rival LifeLock.

Digital Money Manager

In addition to providing services to fix your credit, we provide tools to help manage your financial life. Similar to Mint, our digital money manager tracks your income, spending, transactions, budgets, trends, debts and net worth.

About Lexington Law

A trusted leader in credit repair for over a decade, Lexington Law, we help you understand your rights as a consumer in the credit space, and help you leverage those rights to ensure that you have a fair, accurate, and fully substantiated credit report. We've helped hundreds of thousands of clients repair their credit, and we're confident we can help you too.
