BeagleBox is an Internet-based video system based on the BeagleBoard that is intended for use with TV's that do not support streaming network video. BeagleBox is intended to utilize hardware accelerated graphics features of the OMAP3530 to enhance the end user experience.

BeagleBox is a metabuild system incorporating multiple open source software components: a cross toolchain (Crosstool-NG), bootloader (Das U-Boot), Linux kernel and root file system (Buildroot). BeagleBox builds all software components using local archives to speed rebuilds and testing.  

The build system is based on GNU Make. The system is designed to allow easy experimentation with a variety of sources for these software components.

An important goal of BeagleBox is to provide a stripped down GNU/Linux distribution that is not based on existing distributions.

An add-on component, integrated into the Buildroot component build, is BUI. BUI is a port of Matchbox that serves as the UI environment for BeagleBox.

BeagleBox development is based on Angstrom build system recipes, information from eLinux.org and TI's online communities and contributions from many helpful members of the BeagleBoard community.
